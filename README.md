# BuoyBuddy

This app is for buoy groupies who want to keep tabs on their favorite buoys and check on current weather conditions.

## Users can:
1. View a list of buoys within 100 nautical miles of 40°N, 73°W.
2. Favorite a specific buoy station.
3. List all their favorite buoy stations (including their name, station ID, latitude and longitude) and their current readings.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites:

You will need to have Node (https://nodejs.org/en/download/), Git (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), and a code editor (preferably VS Code - https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

### Instructions:

1. Clone the BuoyBuddy repo by running `git clone https://github.com/schreyerpeter/BuoyBuddy.git` in a terminal window
2. Run `cd BuoyBuddy` to navigate into the project folder
3. Run `yarn install` to install all project dependencies
4. Run `node app.js` to start the backend Express server
5. Run `yarn start` - this should open the app in a browser window, but if it doesn't, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` 
6. That's all! Go favorite some buoys!
